## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Create the HTML Structure: Wrap the generated QR code image inside a container <div> for styling purposes.

Style with CSS:

- Set the container's size, padding, and background to match the design.
- Apply styles to position overlay elements or decorative borders.
- Use CSS properties like border-radius and background-color to customize appearance.

See some code snippets, see below:

```css
.main-card{
  background-color: var(--White);
  width: 200px;
  padding: 1rem 0.65rem;
  border-radius: 5%;
}
```
